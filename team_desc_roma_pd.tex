\section{Robot Description}

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}

The SPQR@Work robot (Fig.~\ref{fig:robot}) is a KUKA youBot with the following sensor suite:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A frontal Hokuyo laser scanner, to be used for navigation and obstacles avoidance tasks
 \item A Kinect RGB-D sensor: the area viewed by the kinect includes the working area of the arm, in order to perform object manipulation tasks without robot motions
 \item An on-board laptop (other than the internal standard Intel Atom PC) running Linux Ubuntu 14.04, to be used to execute the perception and planning tasks (e.g., navigation and object recognition)
 \item A color USB3 high-resolution camera on the 5th joint of the manipulator for accurate object localization
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Software Configuration}

The SPQR@Work software infrastructure is based on the ROS Indigo middleware running on Ubuntu 14.04, nevertheless most of the developed software tools are stand-alone, middleware-agnostic: packages are integrated within ROS by means of suitable wrappers.\\
The navigation stack is based on particle filter based localization and mapping algorithms, provided by the ROS AMCL and GMapping packages, the latter implemented by one member of the laboratory RoCoCo.  Tha base motion planning task is accomplished using two different subsystems (see Fig.~\ref{fig:intro_navigation}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item A global planner, which provides the global path to follow, based on the standard MoveBase ROS package;
 \item A custom-built local planner, which, given the global plan and a costmap, produces
velocity commands to send to the mobile base controller.
\end{itemize}
Our ad hoc local planner is based on artificial potential fields, designed for holonomic mobile robots.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.6\linewidth}
	\begin{center}\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\linewidth]{images/navigation.png}\end{center}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\end{center}
\caption{An example of navigation path (dark gray). The curved portion of the entire path is computed by the primary navigation planner. Our potential fields based planner is used for approaching the final target (red) and for sliding away from obstacles at the beginning of the navigation task (blue).}\label{fig:intro_navigation}
\end{figure}

We use a custom-built module also for the manipulation and the grasping tasks: the arm motion planner we propose is able to plan accurate trajectories assuming that the best way to grasp an object disposed in an crowded environment is to let the gripper follows a straight line in the Cartesian space towards the object of interest.\\

Object recognition and localization is obtained using reliable algorithms that exploit both vision features and depth information (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}). This module includes a pipeline of processing blocks (Fig.~\ref{fig:pipeline}): the pipeline includes processing blocks for sub-sampling, clustering, noise reduction, and 2D and 3D features detection and descriptors. The model matching step is performed associating the extracted features with features pre-computed from a rigid template (e.g., the CAD model) of the object. The result is a set of object candidates, that is refined using an novel object registration strategy. \\

The decision making stack is based on a finite state machine implemented with the ROS Actionlib,

\end{figure*}


Currently, the SPQR@Work robot is able to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Localize itself and safely navigate toward a selected target area
 \item Detect QR code-like markers using vision
 \item Recognize and localize objects using RGB-D sensors, using the techniques proposed in \cite{antonelloVISIGRAPP2014} and \cite{prettoCASE2013}
 \item Perform simple visual servoing and manipulation tasks (e.g., pick and place task, ``cutting a string'' task, \dots)
\end{itemize}

 
\section{Research areas and Contributions}\label{sec:research}

Several research areas are involved in the SPQR@Work team development, and some novel contributions have been proposed. Among others, PWN (Sec.~\ref{sec:pwn}), a semantic mapping and learning system (Sec.~\ref{sec:semantic_map}) and a flexible 3D localization system for industrial bin-picking (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}).


\subsubsection{Object Recognition and Localization}\label{sec:object_rec}
A reliable and accurate object recognition system is an essential prerequisite to successfully compete in the RoCKIn competitions. The SPQR@Work team members presented a robust and flexible vision system for 3D localization of objects for industrial robots \cite{prettoCASE2013} (Fig.~\ref{fig:obj_rec}). This system can estimate the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose of planar objects from a single 2D image.
The localization software is based on a two step strategy: i) a candidate selection step based on a well-engineered voting scheme ii) a refinement and best match selection step based on a robust iterative optimize-and-score procedure. During this second step, a novel strategy called search-in-the-stack is employed, that avoids the optimization from being stuck on local minima (representing false positives) created when objects are almost regularly stacked.

\subsubsection{Obstacle Avoidance and Manipulation}\label{sec:manipulation}
In order to obtain a reliable robot navigation, SPQR@Work team members implemented an efficient obstacle avoidance system for mobile robots equipped with range finder sensors, based on the online computation of local artificial potential fields. \newline In the field of manipulation, an effective framework for handling task priority of redundant manipulators has been studied and developed.

\section{Reusability and Relevance to Industrial Robotics}

\begin{itemize}
 \item PWN (Sec.~\ref{sec:pwn}) became a basic block for a novel traversability analysis algorithm described by Bogoslavskyi et al. in~\cite{bogoslavskyi-ECMR-13}.
 \item The proposed object recognition and localization systems (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}) is currently installed in seven real world industrial plants \footnote{E.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhuEjnDdfI}, with different setups, working with hundreds of different models and successfully guiding the manipulators to pick several hundreds of thousands of pieces per year. 
 \item The proposed task priority manager (Sec.~\ref{sec:manipulation}) is currently implemented inside a real 3D industrial simulator for the off-line programming of workcells and machines with several axis.  \footnote{http://www.it-robotics.it/products/3d-simulation/workcellsimulator/?lang=en}
